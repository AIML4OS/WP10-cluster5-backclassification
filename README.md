This repository provides an example of how to back-classify a standard that has changed. NACE revision 2.1 -> revision 2.0 is provided as an example.

This work was carried out as part of [Work Package 10](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/book-page/aiml4os-wp10-text-code-experiences-and-potential-use-aiml-classifying-and-coding) (Automatic Coding) of the [ESSNet AIML4OS project](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/dashboard/aiml4os). See the [GitHub overview for WP10](https://aiml4os.github.io/WP10/) for more example pipelines.

Special thanks to our colleagues from the [WP2](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/book-page/aiml4os-wp2-communication-and-community-engagement) for providing this tutorial [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python).
